Introduction (2–3 pages)
Background and Related Work (8–10 pages)
2.1 Large Language Models and Alignment
2.2 Safety Risks in LLMs
2.3 Red Teaming – Definition and Importance
2.4 Common Attack Categories (jailbreaking, prompt injection, multi-turn, data poisoning, etc.)
2.5 Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks (safety, robustness, harm categories)
Existing Red-Teaming Tools and Frameworks (10–12 pages) – this will be the biggest chapter now
3.1 Microsoft PyRIT (Python Risk Identification Toolkit)
3.2 Garak (HuggingFace)
3.3 MAD-MAX (Modular Adversarial Red Teaming)
3.4 Armory (MITRE)
3.5 LLM Guard, RedTeam.AI, Promptfoo, Scale Spellbook, etc.
3.6 Comparative table (architecture, supported attacks, automation level, extensibility, licence, last update, community activity)
3.7 Identified Gaps and Limitations (this directly leads to your contribution)
Proposed Toolkit Design (8–10 pages) – this is your real contribution for the semester
4.1 Requirements and Goals
4.2 High-level Architecture (diagram!)
4.3 Core Modules
– Attack Generator (templates, evolutionary, tree-of-thought, etc.)
– Target Interface (OpenAI API, Ollama, HuggingFace, vLLM, local models)
– Judge/Evaluator (regex, LLM-as-a-judge, BERT-based classifiers, multilingual)
– Orchestrator / Scenario Engine (manual mode ↔ automatic mode)
– Reporting & Persistence
4.4 Data Model (harm categories, attack taxonomy)
4.5 Planned Technology Stack (Python 3.11+, Pydantic, LangChain/LangGraph or Haystack, Rich/Click CLI, etc.)
4.6 Comparison with Existing Solutions (why yours is better / more modular / easier to extend)
Implementation (will be added next semester, ~20–25 pages)
Evaluation and Testing (next semester, ~12–15 pages)
Conclusion (3–4 pages)
– Summary of achieved goals
– Contribution
– Limitations
– Future work (multi-modal, agentic attacks, integration with CI/CD, etc.)
