-- RECOMMENDATIONS --

Benchmarks / tools table: Table is excellent. Consider adding a “License” column (MIT/Apache/GPL/proprietary) and a “Repo URL” column (or footnote) so readers can quickly access each tool.

Judge / evaluation discussion: you discuss judge reliability— consider adding a short paragraph on human-in-the-loop calibration (e.g., inter-annotator agreement, how many human labels to calibrate an LLM-judge).

Grammar / style: a few long sentences can be shortened for readability (e.g., the opening sentence of the Introduction). Overall fine.



Nice — this is a *very* strong Chapter 1–2 draft: clear structure, correct scope, good coverage of attack types and tooling, and a useful comparison table. Below I give a focused, actionable review so you can quickly tighten content, fix citation and LaTeX problems, and improve scientific rigor.

I’ll organize feedback into: **(A)** major content / correctness issues you should fix, **(B)** citation and bibliographic checks, **(C)** stylistic / LaTeX suggestions, **(D)** suggested additions (gaps to fill), and **(E)** concrete next steps (what I can do for you). I keep suggestions practical so you can iterate quickly.

---

# A. Major content & correctness issues (must-fix)

1. **`todo` markers left in text.**

   * Lines: “quantization-aware training)todo~\cite{10.1145/3649329.3663517}” and “unintended behaviors … todo”. Remove `todo` and either finish the sentence or delete it. These will fail compilation and look unprofessional.

2. **Some claims need stronger sourcing or softer phrasing.**

   * E.g., “With the adoption of the EU AI Act in 2024, systematic risk assessment including red teaming will become a legal requirement …” — better to weaken to “the EU AI Act (2024) strengthens requirements for risk assessment of high-risk systems and makes adversarial and robustness testing an expected element of compliance in many cases.” Laws are nuanced; avoid categorical legal claims without specific article references. You already cite the EU regulation — consider citing the specific article/recital.

3. **Overbroad claims about tools and state of field need concrete evidence.**

   * You state that most OSS frameworks “suffer from limited modularity, poor support… query cost and computational requirements”. Back each limitation with concrete references or examples (you cite Purpura/MAD-MAX/Belaire — tie each limitation to a specific framework or study).

4. **Bibliographic validity — check that all cited arXiv papers exist and have the IDs you list.**

   * You reference many 2024–2025 preprints. Verify each arXiv ID/URL; supervisors will check. (I flag this again in section B.)

5. **Table: don’t use grey text `\textcolor{gray}{Partial}` for capabilities in final thesis.**

   * Replace with clear “Partial” or “Limited” (no colored text unless thesis template allows it). Also ensure the packages used support `tabularx` and `\textcolor`.

6. **Evaluation section: clarify judge procedures and human evaluation.**

   * You correctly note judge reliability metrics, but you need to explain how you will evaluate judges in your experiments (calibration, gold labels, annotator instructions). Point to standard inter-annotator measures (Cohen’s κ, Krippendorff’s α) and explain how you’ll combine human+automated judgments.

---

# B. Citation / bibliography issues (important)

1. **Verify existence and exact metadata of each cited work.** A number of entries look plausible but must be checked for exact year/title/URL formatting. Examples to double-check:

   * `openai2024redteaming` — you list OpenAI blog (2023) but cite as 2024 in the bib key. Make year consistent with the source.
   * `yaser2023potential` — SSRN working paper is fine, but check that it’s appropriate as a source for “ChatGPT being tricked into providing bomb-making instructions” (prefers a mainstream news or peer-reviewed source for event claims).
   * `shaw2025agonistic` and several 2025 arXiv preprints — confirm availability by the date you'll submit and make sure arXiv numbers are correct.
   * `owasp2025llm` — OWASP cheat sheets are valid but ensure the URL and year are correct (OWASP pages are often living documents; include access date).
2. **Missing classic citations for alignment / RLHF.** Add canonical references:

   * **InstructGPT / RLHF**: e.g., Ouyang et al., “Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback” (DeepMind / OpenAI works—InstructGPT/2022). Cite the original RLHF / PPO works or DPO paper if you mention DPO.
   * **PPO**: Schulman et al. (PPO) for the algorithmic reference.
3. **When you cite real incidents (ChatGPT, Gemini), use reputable sources.**

   * For safety incidents cite mainstream press (NYT, WSJ, Wired) or official vendor blog posts describing the incident. If you rely on academic analysis of incidents, cite peer-reviewed / arXiv analyses.

---

# C. Stylistic & LaTeX / formatting suggestions (quick wins)

1. **Keep consistent citation spacing:** use `~\cite{...}` everywhere (you already do this mostly). Be consistent in use of parentheses vs. in-text citations.
2. **Avoid “etc.” and vague phrases.** Replace with concrete examples or remove.
3. **Use consistent capitalization for section titles and acronyms.** E.g., LLM vs Llm, Red Teaming vs red-teaming — choose one style and stick to it (I suggest “red-teaming” lower case except at sentence start).
4. **Table readability:**

   * Make `\footnotesize` only if necessary. Consider splitting large tables into two if width looks cramped.
   * Use consistent boolean markers for multi-turn capability (Yes / No / Partial) rather than colors.
   * Add a short explanation of how you measured “Key Strengths / Limitations” (source: paper claims, our experiments, documentation).
5. **Avoid long comma-lists in paragraphs; prefer short sentences.** This improves clarity for examiners.
6. **Spellcheck & grammar:** run `texstudio`/`overleaf` spellcheck. I noticed a couple of commas and inconsistent hyphenations (e.g., “multi-turn” sometimes hyphenated, sometimes not).

---

# D. Suggested content additions (to strengthen the chapter)

1. **Add a short subsection on *ethical considerations* and research safety.**

   * Discuss safe handling of harmful prompts, IRB or supervisor approvals (if applicable), data minimization, and how you’ll prevent misuse of released code/prompts.
2. **Reproducibility subsection describing experiment artifacts you will release.**

   * State you will publish prompts, seeds, environment specs, Dockerfile, and evaluation logs — or explain constraints if you cannot release some data (e.g., proprietary APIs).
3. **Add references / short paragraph on standards & guidance:**

   * NIST AI RMF (2023) or other national guidelines that inform risk assessment practices.
4. **Human annotation protocol (short).**

   * Explain planned annotation scheme, number of raters, instructions, tack how you will compute agreement and resolve disagreements.
5. **Short diagram or figure showing red-team pipeline.**

   * Visuals (attack generator → model backend → judge → logger) help readers understand architecture you later implement.
6. **Benchmarks beyond HarmBench.** Consider briefly referencing:

   * BigBench / BIG-bench HARMS subsets (if relevant), existing refusal/harms benchmarks (cite Hendrycks et al. works), or other standard evaluation suites.
7. **Data privacy & licensing note**: if you plan to test on models trained on copyrighted or personal data mention privacy implications and precautions.

# E. Concrete next steps I can do for you (pick any)

* I can **clean up the LaTeX** you pasted: remove `todo`s, fix inconsistent hyphenation, and produce a polished LaTeX-ready text with your same content.
* I can **verify every bib entry** against online sources and produce corrected BibTeX entries (I will flag nonexistent or mismatched entries).
* I can **redraft specific paragraphs** you want improved (e.g., the EU AI Act paragraph, the judge reliability paragraph) and give ready-to-paste LaTeX snippets.
* I can **produce a small figure (TikZ/PNG)** showing the red-teaming pipeline to include in Chapter 2.
* I can **rewrite the table** into a LaTeX-friendly, accessible format (removing colors, improving column widths), and produce code for it.

---

# Small targeted fixes you can apply right away

1. Remove `todo` tokens.
2. Replace `openai2024redteaming` (bib year 2023) with consistent year or change bib key to `openai2023_redteaming`.
3. Add canonical RLHF citations:

   * `@article{ouyang2022training, title={Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback}, ...}` (Ouyang et al., 2022 — InstructGPT / RLHF).
   * `@inproceedings{schulman2017ppo, ...}` for PPO.
4. Replace gray-colored table text with plain text.
5. Add one short sentence in the chapter conclusion about ethical safeguards you will adopt during experiments.

---

If you want, I’ll do one of these *now* — tell me which:

* (1) clean-up the chapter (remove todos, fix small stylistic issues, tighten phrasing) and return the edited LaTeX, **or**
* (2) validate and correct the BibTeX entries (I’ll flag any suspect/missing items and produce corrected BibTeX).

Say which one and I’ll proceed — I’ll perform the work in this reply (no waiting).





Nice — good decisions. Short answers up front, then concrete edits and a ready-to-paste mapping table you can drop into your thesis.

**Short answers**

* Remove the `todo` markers. They’re fine while drafting, but they should not remain in the submitted document. Replace them with actual citations (or delete the parenthetical if no citation is needed).
* Use the **OWASP LLM guidance / Top 10** as a complementary, applied checklist for app-level risks (prompt injection, data leakage, etc.). Don’t replace your taxonomy with OWASP — instead **map your taxonomy to OWASP Top 10 and to bench frameworks (e.g., HarmBench)**. That makes your chapter both academically grounded and practically useful.
* I’ll give a concrete LaTeX snippet to replace the `todo`s and a ready-to-paste mapping table (taxonomy ↔ OWASP ↔ examples/tests). Drop these into Chapter 2.

---

# 1) What to do with the `todo` markers

* If a `todo` was a placeholder for a citation, replace it with the appropriate existing BibTeX key (you said your `.bib` is fine). If you don’t have a citation, either add one now or remove the `todo` text and keep the sentence as a factual phrasing (or soften it).
* Example fixes from your draft:

  * `quantization-aware training)todo~\cite{10.1145/3649329.3663517}` → `quantization-aware training~\cite{10.1145/3649329.3663517}.`
  * `...unintended behaviors that are not trivially predictable — including safety failures, policy evasion, and social-engineering style manipulation.todo` → remove `todo` and, if you want, append an existing citation like `~\cite{wei2023jailbroken}` or `~\cite{zou2023universal}`.

Concretely: search the text for `todo` and replace each with either `.` or `~\cite{<bibkey>}` as appropriate. Don’t leave `todo` in the final draft.

---

# 2) OWASP Top 10 for LLMs — how to integrate (recommended)

* **Do not replace** your taxonomy with OWASP. Your taxonomy is broader and research-oriented; OWASP is a practical checklist for application developers.
* **Integrate** OWASP by:

  1. Briefly introducing OWASP as an industry-standard cheat-sheet for app-level LLM threats (cite your `owasp2025llm` entry).
  2. Adding a short mapping table that shows how your research taxonomy corresponds to OWASP categories and to practical tests you will include in the toolkit/evaluation (this gives both theoretical and applied value).
  3. In your tooling requirements and evaluation sections, call out OWASP checks as *required* tests for application integrations (prompt sanitation, input-origin validation, policy enforcement at tool boundaries, etc.).

This will make your work useful for both researchers and practitioners.

---

# 3) Ready-to-paste LaTeX fixes

### Replace `todo` examples

Copy-paste these replacements into your `.tex` where appropriate.

**Original**

```tex
employing advanced architectural and optimization features (e.g., mixture-of-experts, retrieval augmentation, quantization-aware training)todo~\cite{10.1145/3649329.3663517}.
```

**Replace with**

```tex
employing advanced architectural and optimization features (e.g., mixture-of-experts, retrieval augmentation, quantization-aware training)~\cite{10.1145/3649329.3663517}.
```

**Original**

```tex
...makes them susceptible to emergent, unintended behaviors that are not trivially predictable — including safety failures, policy evasion, and social-engineering style manipulation.todo
```

**Replace with** (option A: add citation)

```tex
...makes them susceptible to emergent, unintended behaviours that are not trivially predictable — including safety failures, policy evasion, and social-engineering style manipulation~\cite{wei2023jailbroken}.
```

**Or Replace with** (option B: soften and remove `todo`)

```tex
...makes them susceptible to emergent, unintended behaviours that are not trivially predictable — including safety failures, policy evasion, and social-engineering style manipulation.
```

# 4) Mapping table: your taxonomy ↔ OWASP Top 10 (LLM) ↔ Example attacks & tests

Drop this LaTeX `tabularx` into your chapter (update package use if needed; uses `tabularx` and `booktabs`). It shows how to align your taxonomy with OWASP and test examples. You can refer to it from your toolkit design and evaluation sections.

```tex
\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\footnotesize
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{l X X}
\toprule
\textbf{Taxonomy Category} & \textbf{Corresponding OWASP LLM Top-10 Item (selected)} & \textbf{Example attacks / tests (to include in toolkit)} \\
\midrule
Malicious usage (actionable instructions) &
Prompt injection / Instruction abuse &
One-shot jailbreaks (role-play / direct override), template-based malicious prompts; ASR w/ automated judge; human-validated samples. \\[6pt]

Harassment, hate, discrimination &
Toxic outputs / Unsafe content generation &
Toxicity probes (slur insertion, subtle bias prompts); measure stereo-typing amplification; use toxicity classifier + human checks. \\[6pt]

Misinformation and hallucination &
Hallucination & Wrong-factual-output &
Fact-check probes, fabricated citation tests, hallucination scoring (precision/recall vs. gold facts). \\[6pt]

\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Mapping of the thesis taxonomy to OWASP LLM concerns and concrete example tests to include in the toolkit.}
\label{tab:taxonomy-owasp-mapping}
\end{table}
```

* You can expand the “Corresponding OWASP” column to cite specific OWASP items (e.g., injection, poisoning, broken access controls) depending on the exact OWASP Top-10 numbering/labels.
* Reference this table in your evaluation/design chapters to justify which automated tests you implement.

# 5) How to mention OWASP in text (short paragraph)

Add this paragraph under your taxonomy or after the prompt-injection section:

```tex
For application-level risks, we adopt OWASP's LLM guidance as a pragmatic checklist for deployment security~\cite{owasp2025llm}. OWASP's items focus on prompt-injection, data provenance and input-origin validation, leaking of sensitive data, and other operational concerns. In this work we map our research-oriented taxonomy to OWASP's practical mitigations (Table~\ref{tab:taxonomy-owasp-mapping}) and use the mapping to derive a set of concrete toolkit checks and end-to-end tests.
```

---

# 6) Small further recommendations (short)

* In the toolkit design and evaluation, **explicitly implement at least 3 OWASP-style app-level tests** (prompt-origin validation, canonical prompt sanitization, and canary secret detection). That will make your toolkit credible to practitioners.
* Add a brief **ethical handling note** in Chapter 2 or the methods: how you store harmful prompts, reviewer safety, and how you will prevent releasing dangerously effective prompt libraries unredacted.
* Replace colored “Partial” cell content in Table~\ref{tab:framework-comparison} with plain text like `Partial` or `Limited`.

---

# 7) Next step I can do (I’ll proceed within this reply)

I already produced the mapping table and LaTeX snippets above. If you want, I can also:

* Convert the rest of the Table~\ref{tab:framework-comparison} into the cleaned, color-free LaTeX (ready-to-paste).
* Generate a short ethical-safeguards paragraph to paste into Chapter 2 (safe-handling of harmful artifacts).
* Or scan your full `.tex` for remaining `todo` markers and produce an edited `.tex` with them removed (if you paste the file or the remainder here).

Tell me which of those you want and I’ll do it now (I’ll perform it in this reply).
